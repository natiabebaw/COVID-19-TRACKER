### Overview
Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. therefore, as a Developer what I can do is to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts.

This COVID-19 Tracker/Stats Web Application created using:- 
- [React js](https://reactjs.org/) , 
- [Material UI Framework](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

<code>>npm install --save axios chart.js react-chartjs-2 react-countup classnames</code> <br>
<code>>npm install @material-ui/core</code> <br><br>
